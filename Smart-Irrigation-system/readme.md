# 🌿 IoT Smart Irrigation System (Web Server Based)

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project monitors soil moisture and automatically waters plants when dry. It uses an ESP8266 microcontroller with an onboard web server that shows real-time soil moisture levels and pump status — all accessible via phone or PC browser connected to the same Wi-Fi.

## 🧰 Components Required
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- Soil Moisture Sensor (analog output)
- 1-Channel Relay Module
- Mini Water Pump or Motor
- 5V Power Supply or Battery
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard
- Wi-Fi Connection (Router or Phone Hotspot)

## 🧠 Key Features
- Soil moisture-based auto-watering
- Local web server UI (no cloud needed)
- Real-time monitoring on browser

## 🌐 Access the Web UI
After uploading the code and connecting to Wi-Fi, open your browser and visit: ip shown in serial monitor setting baud rate to 9600 or directly from the hospot sharing device.
